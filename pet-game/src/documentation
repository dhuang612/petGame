currently trying to get the images that are loaded in with import:

Hereâ€™s a future tip, after you are done coding go back and see 
if redundant code can be replaced. Weigh that against flexibility.
 In the data object the animal name and its image name are the same.  
 The state array can also be filled in with the data.  Nothing to 
 impact play now or coding for next year or two. 
Goal is to make it so change data and everything else updates.
